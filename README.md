# unreal-randomizer
Randomizer for Unreal Gold, and a possible template for future Unreal Engine randomizers.

Download `URando.u` and `URando.int` and place them in your game's System folder, which is probably something like `C:\Program Files (x86)\GOG Galaxy\Games\Unreal Gold\System`.

Make sure to get Unreal patch 227i https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/unreal/oldunreal-patches/
